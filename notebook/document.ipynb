When our business question is, \"What would\\nbe good content to show our users,\" we are facing the machine learning task for\\nrecommendation. Recommender systems are systems set up for information\\nretrieval, a field closely related to NLP that’s focused on finding relevant in-\\nformation in large collections of documents. The goal of information retrieval\\nis to synthesize large collections of unstructured text documents. Within infor-\\nmation retrieval, there are two complementary solutions in how we can offer\\nusers the correct content in our app: search, and recommendations.\\nSearch is the problem of directed [17] information seeking, i.e. the user\\noffers the system a specific query and would like a set of refined results.\\nSearch engines at this point are a well-established traditional solution in\\nthe space.\\nRecommendation is a problem where \"man is the query.\" [58] Here,\\nwe don’t know what the person is looking for exactly, but we would like\\nto infer what they like, and recommend items based on their learned tastes\\nand preferences.\\nThe first industrial recommender systems were created to filter messages\\nin email and newsgroups [22] at the Xerox Palo Alto Research Center based\\non a growing need to filter incoming information from the web. The most\\ncommon recommender systems today are those at Netflix, YouTube, and other\\nlarge-scale platforms that need a way to surface relevant content to users.\\nThe goal of recommender systems is surface items that are relevant to the\\nuser. Within the framework of machine learning approaches for recommenda-\\ntion, the main machine learning task is to determine which items to show to a\\nuser in a given situation. [5]. There are several common ways to approach the\\nrecommendation problem.\\n• Collaborative filtering - The most common approach for creating\\nrecommendations is to formulate our data as a problem of finding\\nmissing user-item interactions in a given set of user-item interaction\\nhistory. We start by collecting either explicit (ratings) data or implicit\\nuser interaction data like clicks, pageviews, or time spent on items,\\nand compute.

Another common approach is using methods\\nsuch matrix factorization, the process of representing users and\\nitems in a feature matrix made up of low-dimensional factor vectors,\\nwhich in our case, are also known as embeddings, and learning those\\nfeature vectors through the process of minimizing a cost function.\\nThis process can be thought of as similar to Word2Vec [43], a deep\\nlearning model which we’ll discuss in depth in this document. There\\nare many different approaches to collaborative filtering, including\\nmatrix factorization and factorization machines.\\n• Content filtering - This approach uses metadata available about our\\nitems (for example in movies or music, the title, year released, genre,\\nand so on) as initial or additional features input into models and\\nwork well when we don’t have much information about user activ-\\nity, although they are often used in combination with collaborative\\nfiltering approaches. Many embeddings architectures fall into this\\ncategory since they help us model the textual features for our items.\\n• Learn to Rank - Learn to rank methods focus on ranking items in\\nrelation to each other based on a known set of preferred rankings\\nand the error is the number of cases when pairs or lists of items\\nare ranked incorrectly. Here, the problem is not presenting a single\\nitem, but a set of items and how they interplay. This step normally\\ntakes place after candidate generation, in a filtering step, because it’s\\ncomputationally expensive to rank extremely large lists.\\n• Neural Recommendations - The process of using neural networks to\\ncapture the same relationships that matrix factorization does without\\nexplicitly having to create a user/item matrix and based on the shape\\nof the input data. This is where deep learning networks, and recently,\\nlarge language models, come into play. Examples of deep learning\\narchitectures used for recommendation include Word2Vec and BERT,\\nwhich we’ll cover in this document, and convolutional and recurrent\\nneural networks for sequential recommendation (such as is found\\nin music playlists, for example). Deep learning allows us to better\\nmodel content-based recommendations and give us representations\\nof our items in an embedding space.

How do we compare \"US\" to \"UK\"?\\nThe process of formatting data correctly to feed into a model is called fea-\\nture engineering. When we have a single continuous, numerical feature, like\\n“the age of the flit in days”, it’s easy to feed these features into a model. But,\\nwhen we have textual data, we need to turn it into numerical representations\\nso that we can compare these representations.\\n2.5\\nNumerical Feature Vectors\\nWithin the context of working with text in machine learning, we represent\\nfeatures as numerical vectors. We can think of each row in our tabular feature\\ndata as a vector. And a collection of features, or our tabular representation,\\nis a matrix.

As we\\nmove into deep learning, we’ll move to PyTorch, a deep learning library\\nthat’s quickly becoming industry-standard for deep learning implemen-\\ntation. There are many different ways of implementing the concepts we\\ndiscuss here, these are just the easiest to illustrate using Python’s ML\\nlingua franca libraries.\\n3.1\\nEarly Approaches\\nThe first approaches to generating textual features were count-based, relying\\non simple counts or high-level understanding of statistical properties: they\\nwere descriptive instead of models, which are predictive and attempt to guess\\na value based on a set of input values. The first methods were encoding\\nmethods, a precursor to embedding. Encoding is often a process that still\\nhappens as the first stage of data preparation for input into more complex\\nmodeling approaches. There are several methods to create text features using\\na process known as encoding so that we can map the geography feature into\\nthe vector space:\\n• Ordinal encoding\\n• Indicator encoding\\n• One-Hot encoding\\nIn all these cases, what we are doing is creating a new feature that maps\\nto the text feature column but is a numerical representation of the variable so\\nthat we can project it into that space for modeling purposes. We’ll motivate\\nthese examples with simple code snippets from scikit-learn, the most common\\nlibrary for demonstrating basic ML concepts. We’ll start with count-based\\napproaches.\\n3.2\\nEncoding\\nOrdinal encoding Let’s again come back to our dataset of flits. We encode our\\ndata using sequential numbers. For example, \"1\" is \"finch\", \"2\" is \"bluejay\" and\\nso on. We can use this method only if the variables have a natural ordered\\nrelationship to each other. For example, in this case \"bluejay\" is not \"more\"\\n26'),\n",

This is the initial solution to the\\nproblem of “how do we recommend flits that are similar to flit that the user\\nhas liked.” This is the process of collaborative filtering.\\nThere are many approaches to collaborative filtering including a\\nneighborhood-based approach, which looks at weighted averages of user\\nratings and computes cosine similarity, between users.

But neural networks\\nas a whole were gaining popularity for natural language modeling because\\nof several key factors. First, in the 1980s, researchers made advancements in\\nusing the technique of backpropagation for training neural networks learning\\n[53]. Backpropagation is how a model learns to converge by calculating the\\ngradient of the loss function with respect to the weights of the neural network,\\nusing the chain rule, a concept from calculus which allows us to calculate\\nthe derivative of a function made up of multiple functions. This mechanism\\nallows the model to understand when it’s reached a global minimum for loss\\nand picks the correct weights for the model parameters, but training models\\nthrough gradient descent. Earlier approaches, such as the perceptron learning\\nrule, tried to do this, but had limitations, such as being able to work only\\non simple layer architectures, took a long time to converge, and experienced\\nvanishing gradients, which made it hard to effectively update the model’s\\nweights.\\nThese advances gave rise to the first kinds of multi-level neural networks,\\nfeed-forward neural networks. In 1998, a paper used backpropagation over\\nmultilayer perceptrons to correctly perform the task of recognizing handwrit-\\nten digit images [40], demonstrating a practical use-case practitioners and\\nresearchers could apply. This MNIST dataset is now one of the canonical\\n\"Hello World\" examples of deep learning.\\nSecond, in the 2000s, the rise of petabytes of aggregated log data resulted\\nin the creation of large databases of multimodal input data scraped from the\\ninternet. This made it possible to conduct wide-ranging experiments to prove\\nthat neural networks work on large amounts of data. For example, ImageNet\\nwas developed by researchers at Stanford who wanted to focus on improving\\nmodel performance by creating a gold set of neural network input data, the\\nfirst step in processing. FeiFei Li assembled a team of students and paid\\ngig workers from Amazon Turk to correctly label a set of 3.2 million images\\nscraped from the internet and organized based on categories according to\\nWordNet, a taxonomy put together by researchers in the 1970s [55].\\nResearchers saw the power of using standard datasets.

Within\\nthe Transformer paper, the model consists of six layers that perform encod-\\ning and six that perform decoding. We start with the encoder layer, which\\nconsists of two sub-layers: the self-attention layer, and a feed-forward neural\\nnetwork. The self-attention layer is the key piece, which performs the process\\nof learning the relationship of each term in relation to the other through scaled\\ndot-product attention. We can think of self-attention in several ways: as a\\ndifferentiable lookup table, or as a large lookup dictionary that contains both\\nthe terms and their positions, with the weights of each term in relationship to\\nthe other obtained from previous layers.\\nThe scaled dot-product attention is the product of three matrices: key,\\nquery, and value. These are initially all the same values that are outputs of\\nprevious layers - in the first pass through the model, they are initially all the\\nsame, initialized at random and adjusted at each step by gradient descent.\\nFor each embedding, we generate a weighted average value based on these\\nlearned attention weights. We calculate the dot product between query and\\nkey, and finally normalize the weights via softmax. Multi-head attention\\nmeans that we perform the process of calculating the scaled dot product\\nattention multiple times in parallel and concatenate the outcome into one\\nvector.\\nAttention(Q, K, V) = so f tmax(QKT\\n√dk\\n)V\\n(12)\\nWhat’s great about scaled dot-product attention (and about all of the layers\\nof the encoder) is that the work can be done in parallel across all the tokens in\\nour codebase: we don’t need to wait for one word to finish processing as we\\ndo in Word2Vec in order to process the next one, so the number of input steps\\nremains the same, regardless of how big our vocabulary is.\\nThe decoder piece differs slightly from the encoder. It starts with a different\\ninput dataset: in the transformer paper, it’s the target language dataset we’d\\nlike to translate the text into. So for example if we were translating our Flit\\nfrom English to Italian, we’d expect to train on the Italian corpus. Otherwise,\\nwe perform all the same actions: we create indexed embeddings that we then\\nconvert into positional embeddings. We then feed the positional embeddings\\nfor the target text into a layer that has three parts: masked multi-headed\\nattention, multiheaded attention, and a feed-forward neural network. The\\nmasked multi-headed attention component is just like self-attention, with one\\nextra piece: the mask matrix introduced in this step acts as a filter to prevent\\nthe attention head from looking at future tokens, since the input vocabulary\\nfor the decoder are our \"answers\", I.e. what the translated text should be.\\nThe output from the masked multi-head self attention layer is passed to the\\nencoder-decoder attention portion, which accepts the final input from the\\ninitial six encoder layers for the key and value, and uses the input from the\\nprevious decoder layer as the query, and then performs scaled dot-product\\nover this.

If we want to search embeddings,\\nwe need a mechanism that is optimized to search through our matrix data\\nstructures and perform nearest-neighbor comparisons in the same way that\\na traditional relational database is optimized to search row-based relations.\\nRelational databases use a b-tree structure to optimize reads by sorting items\\nin ascending order within a hierarchy of nodes, built on top of an indexed\\ncolumn in the database. We can’t perform columnar lookups on our vectors\\nefficiently, so we need to create different structures for them. For example,\\nmany vector stores are based on inverted indices.\\nA general-form embeddings store contains the embeddings themselves, an\\nindex to map them back from the latent space into words, pictures, or text, and\\na way to do similarity comparisons between different types of embeddings\\nusing various nearest neighbors algorithms. We talked before about cosine\\nsimilarity as a staple of comparing latent space representations. This can be-\\ncome computationally expensive over millions of sets of vectors, because we’d\\nneed to do a pairwise comparison over every pair. To solve this, approximate\\nnearest neighbors (ANN) algorithms were developed to, as in recommender\\nsystems, create neighborhoods out of elements of vectors and find a vector’s\\nk-nearest neighbors. The most frequently-used algorithms include HNSW\\n(hierarchical navigable small worlds) and Faiss, both of which are standalone\\nlibraries and also implemented as part of many existing vector stores.\\nThe trade-off between full and nearest neighbor search is that the latter is\\nless precise, but it’s much faster.

But embeddings,\\nlike any machine learning pipeline, need to be refreshed because we might\\nrun into concept drift. Concept drift occurs when the data underlying our\\nmodel changes. For example, let’s say that our model includes, as a binary\\nfeature, people who have landlines or not. In 2023, this would no longer be as\\nrelevant of a feature in most of the world as most people have switched to cell\\nphones as their primary telephones, so the model would lose accuracy.\\nThis phenomenon is even more prevalent with embeddings that are used\\nfor classification. For example, let’s say we use embeddings for trending topic\\ndetection. The model has to generalize, as in the wide and deep model, to\\ndetect new classes, but if our classes change quickly, it may not be able to, so\\nwe need to retrain your embeddings frequently. Or, for example, if we model\\nembeddings in a graph, as Pinterest does, and the relationships between nodes\\nin the graph change, we may have to update them [69]. We could also have an\\ninflux of spam or corrupted content which changes the relationship in your\\nembeddings, in which case we’ll need to retrain.\\nEmbeddings can be hard to understand (so hard that some people have\\neven written entire papers about them) and harder to interpret. What does it\\nmean for a king to be close to queen but far away from the knight? What does\\nit mean for two flits to be close to each other in a projected embedding space?\\nWe have two ways we can think about this, intrinsic and extrinsic evalua-\\ntion. For the embeddings themselves (extrinsic evaluation), we can visualize\\nthem through either UMAP—Uniform Manifold Approximation and Projec-\\ntion for Dimension Reduction or t-sne — t-distributed stochastic neighbor\\nembedding, algorithms that allow us to visualize highly-dimensional data in\\ntwo or three dimensions, much like PCA. Or we can fit embeddings into our\\ndownstream task (for example, summarization, or classification), and analyze\\nthe same way we would with offline metrics. There are many different ap-\\nproaches [67] but the summary is that embeddings can be objectively hard to\\nevaluate and we’ll need to factor the time to perform this evaluation into our\\nmodeling time.\\nOnce we retrain our initial baseline model, we now have a secondary issue:\\nhow do we compare the first set of embeddings to the second; that is, how do\\nwe evaluate whether they are good representations of our data, given the case\\nthat embeddings are often unsupervised; i.e. — how do we know whether\\n\"king\" should be close to \"queen\"? On their own, as a first-pass, embeddings\\ncan be hard to interpret, because in a multidimensional space it’s hard to\\nunderstand which dimension of a vector corresponds to a decision to place\\nitems next to each other [63]. When compared to other sets of embeddings,\\nwe might use the offline metrics of the final model task, precision and recall,\\nor we could measure the distance of the distribution of the embeddings in the\\n74'),\n",

This goes hand-in-hand with the\\nproblem of model versioning in ML operations, except in this case we need to\\nboth version the model and the output data.\\nThere are numerous different approaches to model and data versioning\\nthat involve building a system that tracks both the metadata and the location\\nof the assets that are kept in a secondary data store. Another thing to keep in\\nmind is that embedding layers, particularly for large vocabularies, can balloon\\nin size, so now we have to consider storage costs, as well.\\n5.2.4\\nInference and Latency\\nWhen working with embeddings, we are operating not only in a theoretical,\\nbut practical engineering environment. The most critical engineering part of\\nany machine learning system that works in production is inference time —\\nhow quickly does it take to query the model asset and return a result to an\\nend-user.\\nFor this, we care about latency, which we can roughly define as any time\\nspent waiting and is a critical performance metric in any production system\\n[26]. Generally speaking, it’s the time of any operation to complete – appli-\\ncation request, database query, and so on. Latency at the level of the web\\nservice is generally measured in milliseconds, and every effort is made to\\nreduce this as close to zero as realistically possible. For use-cases like search\\nand loading a feed of content, the experience needs to be instantaneous or the\\nuser experience will degrade and we could even lose revenue. In a study from\\na while back, Amazon found that every 100ms increase in latency cuts profits\\nby 1% [19].\\nGiven this, we need to think about how to reduce the footprint of our\\nmodel and all the layers in serving it so that the response to the user is\\ninstantaneous. We do this by creating observability throughout our machine\\nlearning system, starting with the hardware the system is running on, to\\nCPU and GPU utilization, the performance of our model architecture, and\\nhow that model interacts with other components. For example, when we are\\nperforming nearest neighbor lookup, the way we perform that lookup and the\\nalgorithm we use, the programming language we use to write that algorithm,\\nall compound latency concerns.\\nAs an example, in the wide and deep paper, the recommender ranking\\nmodel scores over 10 million apps per second. The application was initially\\nsingle-threaded, with all candidates taking 31 milliseconds. By implementing\\nmultithreading, they were able to reduce client-side latency to 14 milliseconds\\n[7].\\nOperations of machine learning systems is an entirely other art and craft\\nof study and one that’s best left for another paper [37].\\n75'),\n",

When we talk about offline tests,\\nwe mean analyzing the statistical properties of a model to learn whether the\\nmodel is a valid model - i.e. does our loss function converge? Does the model\\noverfit or underfit? What is the precision and recall? Do we experience any\\ndrift? If it’s a recommendation ranker model, are we using metrics like NDCG\\n—normalized discounted cumulative gain— to understand whether our new\\nmodel ranks items better than the previous iteration?\\nThen, there is online evaluation, aka how successful the model actually\\nis in the production context. Usually, this is evaluated through A/B testing\\nwhere one set of users gets the old model or system and a holdout set of users\\ngets the new system, and looking at the statistical significance of metrics like\\nclick-through rate, items served, and time spent on a given area of the site.\\n5.2.6\\nWhat makes embeddings projects successful\\nFinally, once we have all our algorithmic and engineering concerns lined up,\\nthere is the final matter to consider of what will make our project successful\\nfrom a business perspective. We should acknowledge that we might not\\nalways need embeddings for our machine learning problem, or that we might\\nnot need machine learning at all, initially, if our project is based entirely on a\\nhandful of heuristic rules that can be determined and analyzed by humans\\n[76].\\nIf we conclude that we are operating in a data-rich space where automati-\\ncally inferring semantic relationships between entities is correct, we need to\\nask ourselves if we’re willing to put in a great deal of effort into producing\\nclean datasets, the baseline of any good machine learning model, even in cases\\nof large language models.
